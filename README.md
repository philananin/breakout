Breakout
========

Just thought I'd have a go at some Python, since it's been quite some time since I used it last. It's also an opportunity for me to finally create a game that actually works (well, hopefully), even if it's just a Breakout clone.

It uses curses to render the game in the terminal.

Setup
=====

Run `python main.py`. That's it.
