Breakout
========

Just thought I'd have a go at some Python, since it's been quite some time since I used it last. It's also an opportunity for me to finally create a game that actually works (well, hopefully), even if it's just a Breakout clone.

It uses curses to render the game in the terminal.

Yes, I know about pygame. I'm trying to make sure I understand the fundamentals before I use libraries or frameworks.

Setup
=====

At the moment it'll only work on OSX with afplay installed, because I haven't yet figured out a cross-platform way to play sounds yet.

Run `python3 main.py`. That's it.
